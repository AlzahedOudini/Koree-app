                SARL et est destiné à être utilisé tel quel. Cette page est utilisée

L’ensemble des informations recueillies auprès des Membres dans le cadre de leur usage des applications sont tenues par KOREE pour confidentielles.</p>
            <p>KOREE attire toutefois l’attention de chaque Membre sur le fait que tout contenu publié par le Membre sur les applications pourra être consulté par tout utilisateur sur les applications. Des options de désactivation sont mises à la disposition des Membres.</p>
            <p>Lorsque le Membre est invité à communiquer des données personnelles par le biais des applications, KOREE indiquera les données personnelles que le Membre doit obligatoirement communiquer pour pouvoir bénéficier du service concerné. Lorsque la communication de certaines données personnelles revêt un caractère facultatif, le Membre n’est pas obligé de les communiquer pour pouvoir bénéficier du service.
